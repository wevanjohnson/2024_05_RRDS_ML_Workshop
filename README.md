# Red Rock Data Science Kernel Machine Learning Workshop (2024)
These are the materials for our Kernel Machine learning workshop at the Red Rock Data Science Student Conference at Southern Utah University in 5/2024. Hopefully they are helpful!

## Things you should know about this course

* Lots of diverse material and new concepts will be covered in this course
    + Machine Learning is __NOT__ a spectator sport! You need to practice the skills you learn over and over again!
* Communication: if you have questions or concerns, please email me: <w.evan.johnson@rutgers.edu>
* GitHub materials for the course:
    + All materials for this course will be posted on the course GitHub page: [https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2024_05_RRDS_ML_Workshop/edit/main/README.md](https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2024_05_RRDS_ML_Workshop/edit/main/README.md)
    + You obviously have this since you are here!
